Now we are creating the project structure of expense using the vpc

In our case to store the remote state data we can't directly declare it in state.tf file because we have multiple
environments so to store the data based on the environment we have declaring separately in state.tfvars(env-dev) and
state.tfvars(env-prod)
  Now if i give terraform init directly it will ask to name the s3 bucket, because of empty background we have provided
     in state.tf file
  So if we want it to not ask the s3 bucket and execute it we have t provide the below command
     terraform init -backend-config=env-dev/state.tfvars
