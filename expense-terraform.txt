Now we are creating the project structure of expense using the vpc

In our case to store the remote state data we can't directly declare it in state.tf file because we have multiple
environments so to store the data based on the environment we have declaring separately in state.tfvars(env-dev) and
state.tfvars(env-prod)
  Now if i give terraform init directly it will ask to name the s3 bucket, because of empty background we have provided
     in state.tf file
  So if we want it to not ask the s3 bucket and execute it we have t provide the below command
     terraform init -backend-config=env-dev/state.tfvars

  Now after executing the above command for dev environment and if i rum for the prod environment, it push an error,
   telling that we have initialized a remote backend and asking to reconfigure the things
     terraform init -backend-config=env-prod/state.tfvars

  Actually it is a slight problem all the time in order to deal with that when we are actually on the same directory
  dealing with two environments terraform has a solution there.

  the solution is terraform work spaces we can create a work space and start executing there, but we are not going to use in our case

  We can directly deal it by giving ls -A command and then ls .terraform there w ecn see the terraform.tfstate now we
  directly delete by giving the rm -f .terraform/terraform.tfstate so it will delete the existing and we acn run for the
  prod environment
       ls -A  --> ls .terraform --> rm -f .terrraform/terraform.tfstate
       terraform init -backend-config=env-prod/state.tfvars     ---> now it initialize successfully with out any error
